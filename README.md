### Module
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. A module can define functions, classes, and variables. A module can also include executable code.  
Note : We can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file. ```import calc```
#### Pythonâ€™s from statement lets you import specific attributes from a module. The from .. import .. has the following syntax:
```diff
from math import sqrt, factorial
```
The * symbol used with the from import the statement is used to import all the names from a module to a current namespace.
```
from module_name import *
```
### dir() Function
The dir() built-in function returns a sorted list of strings containing the names defined by a module. The list contains the names of all the modules, variables, and functions that are defined in a module.
```
from random import *
print(dir(random))
```
